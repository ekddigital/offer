Alright, i would like us to get back to the andoffer project

lets make sure we fix the navigation and even the colors pattern so that we can better fix things and meke thing svisible. i am not seeing the footer being fixed, also i am not seeing the different routes that we have

moreover, we need to propoerly fix the navigation and links and lets remember to read the andgroupco/ project to better fix the andoffer footer with the address and ohter things

moreover, in the andoffer project i am seing in the navbar "A.N.D. GROUP OF COMPANIES LLC" but we really do not need it to be displayed like that.

the main name for the side is AND Offer

since it is like our portal for products for our A.N.D. GROUP OF COMPANIES LLC

we can make things more better

we want to add these to the hero as well or add it to a better place
